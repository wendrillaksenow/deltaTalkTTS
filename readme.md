# DeltaTalk TTS add-on for NVDA - Initial prototype


## This is an early prototype of the DeltaTalk TTS synthesizer, developed as an add-on for NVDA.

* At the time of writing, the synthesizer, although recognized by NVDA, was not loaded and did not work at all. However, this document is only an initial draft and the situation with the synthesizer may have changed.

* This prototype serves as a starting point for future developments.
